        <span style="text-align:justify">KÜR™ has ingredients and supplements proven to help your body as it processes alcohol. This includes both hangover symptoms and alcohol flush from the liver.<br/><br/>
        The ingredients in KÜR™ help your body detox, break down the alcohol, and replenish key nutrients lost during a night of drinking. KÜR™ also helps the liver remove toxins from alcohol and the main cause of hangovers and alcohol flush, so hangover symptoms like headaches and nausea do not set in.<br/><br/>
        KÜR™ has a special blast cap which holds all the dry ingredients. When the bottle is opened and you hear a snap, all the dry ingredients fall into the liquid. Shaking the bottle will help combine the elements together.<br/><br/>
        We recommend that you drink KÜR™ when you finish drinking.  Of course, if you don't realize how much you really drank until you wake up, drinking it the next day works too – just allow 20-40 minutes for it to take effect.</span>
